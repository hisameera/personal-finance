Filing your income tax doesn’t have to be complicated! Here’s a beginner-friendly guide for young Indians to understand and file personal income tax with confidence.

## What is Personal Income Tax?
Personal income tax is a tax you pay on your earnings (salary, business, investments, etc.) to the government. It helps fund public services and infrastructure.

## Who Needs to File?
- If your total income exceeds the basic exemption limit (₹2.5 lakh for most individuals)
- If you have income from salary, freelancing, business, or investments
- If you want to claim a refund or carry forward losses

## Quick Overview: Tax Slabs & ITR Forms

### Tax Slabs (FY 2024-25)
India has two tax regimes: old and new. Here’s a quick look at the new regime for individuals below 60 years:

| Income Range         | Tax Rate |
|----------------------|----------|
| Up to ₹2.5 lakh      | Nil      |
| ₹2.5 – ₹5 lakh       | 5%       |
| ₹5 – ₹7.5 lakh       | 10%      |
| ₹7.5 – ₹10 lakh      | 15%      |
| ₹10 – ₹12.5 lakh     | 20%      |
| ₹12.5 – ₹15 lakh     | 25%      |
| Above ₹15 lakh       | 30%      |

Old regime allows more deductions but has different slabs. Choose what suits you best.
